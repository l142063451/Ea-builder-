# ISVGPU: Infinite Superposition Virtual GPU

## Overview

**ISVGPU** is a research and engineering project exploring the concept of "infinite superposition bits" (IDVBits) and attempting to emulate massively parallel solution-search capabilities on classical hardware through advanced mathematical techniques.

⚠️ **Research Notice**: This project is explicitly speculative and research-oriented. Many theoretical claims (infinite-state bits, general O(1) solutions for NP-hard problems) contradict current proven computational and physical theory. All claims are clearly marked as PROVEN, HEURISTIC, or SPECULATIVE.

## Key Features

- **Mathematical Foundations**: Formal power series, generating functions, tensor networks, knowledge compilation
- **IDVBit Engine**: Multiple representation backends (symbolic, decision diagrams, tensor networks)
- **vGPU Compatibility**: User-space shim layers for CUDA, OpenCL, and Vulkan APIs
- **Scientific Rigor**: Clear distinction between proven techniques and speculative research

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/l142063451/Ea-builder-
cd Ea-builder-

# Build Rust components
cd rust && cargo build --release

# Setup Python environment  
cd ../python && poetry install

# Run test suite
./scripts/run_tests.sh
```

## Architecture

### Core Components
- **IDVBit Core**: Fundamental infinite-dimensional vector bit implementations
- **God Index**: Problem-to-solution indexing system  
- **Tensor Networks**: High-dimensional compression and contraction
- **vGPU Shim**: GPU API compatibility layer

### Mathematical Techniques (Proven)
- Knowledge compilation (d-DNNF, SDD, OBDD)
- Tensor Train decompositions and contraction
- Generating function coefficient extraction
- Combinatorial transforms (Möbius, Zeta, Walsh-Hadamard)

### Practical Applications
- Structured SAT solving with precompilation
- Combinatorial optimization on bounded-width instances  
- Tensor-based machine learning acceleration
- Algebraic computation routing through vGPU interface
