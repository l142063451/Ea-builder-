Vision

Empower non-programmers and pros to design, test, and export robust FX strategies visually—safely, transparently, and fast—on a platform that’s delightful, educational, and production-grade.

Strategic Goals

1. Create an original visual strategy builder with first-class UX and correctness.


2. Guarantee exportable, compilable MQL4/MQL5 code with safety guards.


3. Deliver reproducible backtests and clear performance reports.


4. Operate a secure, observable, and maintainable SaaS with full admin control.


5. Scale via modular architecture, feature flags, and automated CI/CD.



Success Metrics

95%+ successful compile rate for generated EAs from sample graphs.

90%+ test pass rate in CI; P95 API latency < 250ms at 200 RPS on DO.

<1% weekly error budget breach (SLO).

Time-to-first-strategy (new user) < 10 minutes.


Principles

Safety by default, originality, determinism, transparency, admin-first configurability.

No placeholders—real implementations or feature-flagged omissions with docs.
